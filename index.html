        <h1>Cookie Tools <small>Infos about a stupid law</small></h1>
      </div>
      <p>This webpage is not showing a cookie disclaimer and will not show one anytime soon, because it does not use cookies. Due to this I will never know how many of you have used this page.</p>
      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>Do you like it when you go to your favourite restaurant, and you go there often, the waiters know you and treat you as a friendly member of the family? Do you like it when the shopkeepers remember your face and name and maybe keep the shops open a few minutes more just because it's you? Well, on the web one of the easiest ways to do that is through cookies. And these Cookies are simple text files that keep track of codes that enable the webpage to identify you and personalize your experience, from avoiding the login procedure, to styling options for the page, to, sometimes, more complex personalizations. And just as in the shop case, where the shopkeeper remembers what you bought, in order to avoid offering you the same products all over again, with a very practical "economical" target, the same happens with cookies: The behaviour you have on a page is tracked and helps understanding better what to offer you the next time and how to offer it to you in the most impactful way.</p>
      <p>So, in what way is this different from having a store with a few people serving. They will know your habits and will be able to take decisions based on them, you will not have anything to say on that. Is that so much different from the web? Or better, do we really want that to be different from the Internet? And, if I may, why would we want that? If this is illegal, so have to be in-company CRMs that keep track of what customers are doing in physical shops and companies. Or it is just the annual spring-rite that requires the commission to attack technology and internet, making it every day more difficult for EU Startups to be competitive in a global market, while the good old brick and mortar shop is still a good place for voters to come. Because to "get" the internet you have to understand it: Kids understand it, teenagers undertand it, young adults understand it. Who doesn't are mid-age adults and elderly, and in an aging European Community that is a big issue, because of the 5 called categories, the ones expressing their votes are only 3 of them, and only 1 of 3 "gets" the Internet, and that means one. only. thing. 60% of potential voters don't get the Web, so the brick and mortar shop counts more votes than any web-app startup and any mobile agency. And that is a sad fact.</p>
      <p>Let me add that if privacy had been a concern for you until now, you would have plugins in your browser that opt you out of the general tracking systems (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keep-my-opt-outs/hhnjdplhmcnkiecampfdgfjilccfpfoe?hl=en">Keep My Opt-outs</a>, <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-out</a> and similar tools). If it has never been a concern, maybe it will not become one now.</p>
      <h2>How do cookies work?</h2>
      <p>A website might want to keep information from one page to the other. If it does, it might use many ways: a parameter in the URL, but that might be inscure, a "POST" parameter, but that might be problematic for the structure of the pages, or by storing that information on the server and giving the user a small "token" that helps him being recognized, like with your favourite bookshop fidelity card, and that is the cookie. What happens with most fidelity cards is that they can be given only by the chain that emits them and only that chain accepts them. Exactly the same happens to be true for Cookies: <b style="font-size:2em">if example.com emits a cookie, only example.com will be able to read it and nobody else.</b> If anybody tells you otherwise, know that he or she is lying. When somebody tells you about "third party cookies", this is disinformation, because there is no such thing as a third party cookie. Only first party cookies can be emitted. What can happen is that not everyone has all services and all technology available, and as such uses other services to offer functionalities on the webpage. And while doing that cookies of the other parties come with the services. Is that a problem? Not on the security part, because only the third party reads the third party (same party) cookie, not me, not anybody else. Not on the technical part, because the browser will stop any request from a different domain than the one emitting the cookie from reading it.</p>
      <h2>A few words on the law</h2>
      <p>This page wants to help you understand what you need to do and what not, as well as displaying tools for the most common platforms to implement that law.</p>
      <p>This webpage is in <b>no way</b> in favor of the cookie law, and is in fact deeply against that law. A social issue can and will not be solved by impeding a specific technical solution. New solutions will come and they will be just more complicated to avoid and to legalize. What is the next step? Illegality of &lt;frame> and &lt;iframe> elements? No more &lt;embed>? No more javascript? Sorry, but that is not the Internet made of hypertexts that it could and should be, it's a regression. Privacy is a concern? It sure has to be, but saying that a "cookie awareness program" solves the privacy issues is just like saying that knowing the calories on a cookie will stop you from eating it. It's at best hypocritical, if not simply a justification of public money for a stupid and useless law.</p>
      <p>And it is very complicated, because, on a sidenote, the law is european, yet the implementation of the law depends on the various countries. So UK law is completely different from Spanish, Swedish and Italian law, making everything more interesting and almost impossible, considering that even the definition itself of the various types of cookies is completely different from country to country (UK considers analytics as technical cookies, while Italy considers them profiling cookies with a different impact on privacy).</p>
      <p>For more details (legalese), here is the info from the EC itself: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm">Cookies</a></p>
      <p>All in all, it is a stupid law, made by lawyers who have NEVER EVER seen a line of code and who have not the slightest clue on how the web works. And the national addenda are maybe even worse.</p>
      <p>Yet, at the moment we have to comply.</p>
      
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h3>Pros of the law</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>You will be aware of the fact that you will be tracked on a website. Thing that already happens with logs on a webserver, with javascript running and other little tricks nobody will tell you about because it is not strictly needed. But you will know that for sure you are aware of the cookies.</li>
              <li>The industry will get a boost on other tracking technologies that were almost ignored up to now, maybe favouring the birth of apps that wrap the webpage or other funny solutions that avoid the issue (to install an app you have to accept a license agreement [that usually nobody reads - maybe we could install by law eyeball-tracking systems that guarantee that a user has really read the license agreement and was not watching a kitten video on youtube]).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h3>Cons of the law</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>To avoid issues, many EU sites will eliminate most cookies, to avoid the fines, offering worse services than their counterparts in the rest of the world</li>
              <li>Small start-ups and blogs will have issues with their users</li>
              <li>Big companies like FB, Google, MS will not care about the fines and as of now are ignoring the whole banner thing and pay the few coins of fines in a billion dollar system. If they EVER get the fines anyway.</li>
              <li>The end users will get worse services and will go to the big tracking companies, that are using their own tracking solutions making their "third party tracking cookies" directly "first party technical cookies" and winning the war.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <p>As a result of this, the big companies, for which the EU has a strange BDSM attraction because they bring awesome services but not as much taxes as they would like, are free to do as they wish, for everyone else, it's a problem. Who wins? Not EU, Not EU citizens, Not EU companies. Thanks for this useful law.</p>
